# base64enc

small gleam base64 converter made for the sake of learning

# DO NOT USE THIS

Just use the standard library functions:

- [bit_array/base64_encode](https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/bit_array.html#base64_encode)
- [bit_array/base64_decode](https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/bit_array.html#base64_decode)

If you somehow stumble upon this repo, don't try using it for doing base64 conversion in gleam.
This is a gleam-based implementation done for the sake of learning the language.

It's not done trying to be efficient.
